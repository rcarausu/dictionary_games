# Dictionary Games

This repository contains different implementations of popular word based games in different languages.

## Project structure
The code is currently organized in three main modules:
* _dictionary_: This is where the different dictionary parsers are located.
* _domain_: Main domain classes for the projects such as games, exceptions, etc.
* _games_: Implementations of the different games of the project.

## Working with the code
The project uses [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) as a project management and comprehension tool and
[Amazon Corretto 11](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/what-is-corretto-11.html) as JDK.

Plugins:
* [surefire - 2.22.2](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/index.html): Run the JUnit unit tests in an isolated classloader.

### Executing tests
* Run all tests by executing `mvn surefire:test` or `mvn test`.
* Test a single class by executing `mvn -Dtest=<class name without exension> test`.
  * ex: `mvn -Dtest=TestHexLetters test`.
* More information on how to execute single tests [here](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/examples/single-test.html).
